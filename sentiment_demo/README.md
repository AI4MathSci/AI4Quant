# Sentiment Demo

This folder provides a basic example of how we might integrate sentiment analysis outputs into our quant finance platform.

## Files

- `example_sentiment.csv` — A mock dataset of sentiment scores over time from Reddit and news sources.
- `plot_sentiment.py` — A script to visualize sentiment scores over time.
- `sentiment_over_time.png` — Output plot (generated by the script).

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have `matplotlib` and `pandas`:
   ```
   pip install matplotlib pandas
   ```

2. Run the plot script:
   ```
   python plot_sentiment.py
   ```

## Ideas for Improvement

- Add cumulative sentiment score plot.
- Correlate sentiment with asset price movements.
- Add sentiment weights to trading signals.
- Incorporate NLP fine-tuning for better scoring.

This is meant to demonstrate how sentiment can be logged, visualized, and integrated into our broader trading strategy platform.
